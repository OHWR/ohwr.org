The Open Hardware Repository [ohwr.org](https://www.ohwr.org) is a place on the
web which was created in 2009 so electronics designers at experimental physics
facilities could have a space to collaborate on Open Source Hardware (OSHW)
designs, much in the philosophy of the free software movement.

In its latest incarnation, it is an easy-to-browse catalogue of OSHW designs,
still limited in scope to controls and data acquisition for physics, with links
to the designs themselves (now hosted elsewhere) and to forums where you can
participate in discussions around those designs.

As a visitor, you can use ohwr.org to find designs and communities you might be
interested in. As a designer, you can use it as a window to the world for your
designs, by [submitting your projects]({{< relref "submit-project" >}}) so we
can include them in the catalogue.

Write to us at [ohwr-support@cern.ch](mailto:ohwr-support@cern.ch) with any
questions or comments. Happy browsing!
